To start off I would like to say that I have never actually coded in python or used pygame at all, so everything you see was a complete first for me, I learned a lot doing this assignment,
all of my sound has been completely created by me in FL studio and is what I would say to be the most impressive aspect of my game. I've only coded in java and some c here at western so far, but this has really opened up my eyes to game programming and all the small details that go into it! I learned the most about the pygame libraries and basically all there is to know about python which has been very helpful, just the fact of learning python alone from doing this game was worth it! I also learned a lot about physics in class but was unable to do much with it in this 2d game. I sued images that were provided online, and just general ideas I found to present you with a simple game that I created. It isn't very complex at all but I really enjoyed making it and I hope you can tell I learned a lot, I really look forward to creating the next game in blnder 3d.
